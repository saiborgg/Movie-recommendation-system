# Movie-recommendation-system
This project implements a content-based movie recommender system that suggests movies similar to a given title based on their descriptions or metadata. The core idea is to compare the textual content of movies—such as their plot summaries, genres, or tags—and identify those that are most alike. To achieve this, the project utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert the textual data into numerical representations. TF-IDF helps in giving higher weight to important and unique terms in a movie’s description while reducing the impact of commonly occurring words across all movies.

Once the text is vectorized, Cosine Similarity is applied to measure the similarity between movie vectors. Cosine Similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which gives a measure of how close two movies are in terms of their content. A score close to 1 indicates high similarity. Additionally, the project uses the difflib.get_close_matches function to allow flexible and approximate matching of user input movie titles with those in the dataset, improving user experience by handling minor typos or incomplete titles.

When a user inputs a movie name, the system first finds the closest match in the dataset, then retrieves and ranks the top N most similar movies based on cosine similarity scores. This approach ensures relevant and personalized recommendations without relying on user ratings or collaborative filtering. The model is fast, interpretable, and effective for smaller datasets or when user interaction data is unavailable, making it a strong foundational approach to building intelligent recommendation engines.
